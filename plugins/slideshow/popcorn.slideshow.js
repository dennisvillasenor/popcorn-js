/* 
* Popcorn Slideshow Plugin
* Much of the details of this plugin are still being ironed out with Dave 
* Seifried basically this plugin will be a slideshow application that will run 
* under Baseplayer.   The slideshow will have a manual or auto play mode in
* which the slideshow will move through each slide either after user input such
* as a keystroke (manual) or after a period of time has passed (auto).
*
* As already mentioned Baseplayer will be used to run the application though how
* it will do so I will still need clarification from Dave and Scott.
*
* This slideshow will work in a similar fashion to a powerpoint presentation
* than a conventional image slideshow allowing users to show text, images and
* quite possibly even embedded video without the need for installing a flash
* plugin.
